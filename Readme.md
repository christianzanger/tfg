# Project structure
- **public**: JS, Images and CSS (minified or "classic")
    - **images**
        - **searches**: subdirectories and images created by generation.js
        - **static**: images that shouldn't change (home bg and featured)
    - **pages**: HTML files
        - **react**: HTML files for loading each page with react and different bundles instead of using only 1 bundle. (used later for server vs client routing)
    - **scripts**: client JS
        - **bundles**: React JS bundles
        - **cookies**: classes for handling Stats and Settings cookies
        - **libraries**: materialize and other libraries (TODO)
    - **styles**: CSS
- **server.js**: main entry point. Calls middleware and routes.
- **middleware.js**: all the middlewares (for example cookie parsing and compression if activated)
- **routes.js**: all the endpoints
- **src**: server-side stuff. Here shouldn't be anything that gets requested from the client.
    - **app**: for example generation.js
    - **components**: React components
